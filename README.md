# fog2-reference-sheet

A web app which displays unit data and rules for the Field of Glory 2 computer game. A live version is available [here](http://fog2.lsm.scot/)

The various army lists are selectable and the rules applicable to each unit are summarised. Built with create-react-app and react-table. [fog2-army-parse](https://github.com/lawrie-sm/fog2-army-parse) is used to extract some of the data. This should be easily adaptable to any other games using the same engine.
